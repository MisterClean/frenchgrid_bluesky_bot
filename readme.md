# French Grid Bluesky Bot

A Bluesky bot that posts regular updates comparing the carbon intensity of France's electrical grid with other European countries. The bot fetches data from ElectricityMaps API every 6 hours and creates posts showing:

- Carbon intensity (gCO2/kWh) for both countries
- Top 3 power sources and their percentages
- Visual indicators for carbon intensity levels
- Country flags

## Example Post

```
ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· FRANCE: 28g CO2/kWh ðŸŸ¢ using 73% Nuclear, 12% Solar and 7% Hydro.

ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª GERMANY: 320g CO2/kWh ðŸ”´ using 40% Wind, 20% Coal and 16% Solar.

Provided by @ElectricityMaps, data is about live consumption for the past hour as of 14:00 UTC
